%   PERSONAL PROFILE
%----------------------
\section{Personal Profile/Objective}
I am an undergraduate with a mature outlook seeking a year long industrial placement aiming to put my advanced knowledge of mathematics and computer science in practice.
I have a logical mind and demonstrated my ability to understand complex ideas quickly whilst working on a research project at Cardiff University when I was chosen out of 160 of my peers to undertake a research internship (Summer 2013-2014).
I am an excellent communicator and am comfortable speaking in front of large groups, which I showed when I presented my work at an International Conference (March 2013-2014).

%	WORK EXPERIENCE

\section{Experience}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}

\textsc{Summer} & Building Game Theoretical Software in a Research Environment \\
\textsc{2014}& \footnotesize{I was employed by Cardiff University Department of Mathematics, working for Dr. Vincent Knight to lead the department's contribution to the open source mathematics package, Sage.
I was responsible for the implementation of a variety of Game Theoretic algorithms that will be included in a future release of Sage (an open source Mathematics software package).
Areas of Game Theory handled included: Normal Form Games, Co-operative Games and Matching Games.
This employment developed my teamwork and communication skills by providing experience of working within a research environment.}\\
\\
%------------------------------------------------
\textsc{Sept 2010 -} & Referee with the Rugby Football Union \\
\textsc{Present} & \footnotesize{Whilst most teenagers might have a Saturday job, I began refereeing rugby union at the age of 15.
New referees start at level 15 and within 3 years, I had been promoted to level 6 - the highest regional level and only one below the point where I could referee national level games.
The experience of taking charge of 30 men (often twice my age) in an aggressive and physical sport has given me confidence in my ability to remain calm in stressful situations.}\\
\\
%------------------------------------------------
\textsc{Sept 2009 -} & Young Leader at 1\textsuperscript{st} Helsby Scouts\\
\textsc{Jul 2013}& \footnotesize{I developed communication skills whilst helping to supervise and teach children aged 6 - 10 years.
I was regularly assigned to lead small group activities which improved my organisation and leadership skills.}\\

\section{Programming Skills}
I am proficient in most aspects of computing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating Systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux (server and client);
    \item General software: Excel, Word Processing (\LaTeX\, Microsoft Word, Libre office), Presentation (Beamer, Microsoft Powerpoint);
    \item Programming: Python, Django, Sql, Ruby, C and well evidenced ability to gain proficiency in new languages quickly.
\end{itemize}

During my first year at University I gained proficiency in the web framework Django and developed a dynamic website: \url{http://thefightclub.herokuapp.com/}.

%	INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES
%-----------------------------
\section{Acheivments and Interests}
I have been involved in Scouting from the age of 8, playing a \textbf{leading role} in the organisation both as member and a leader.
Recently, I was appointed a group-wide, adult leader position which will allow me to continue the work I have been doing whenever I am home from University. \\
\\
I have played Rugby Union from the age of 5, reaching County standard and playing for the Welsh Exiles before injury prevented me from carrying on.
This gave me a lot of experience of \textbf{working within a team}, both as a \textbf{captain} and a member. \\
\\
On starting at Cardiff University, I decided to take up a new sport in order to maintain my level of fitness.
I chose Ultimate Frisbee as it is a team sport, is physically demanding but is non-contact and so reduces the risk of injury which might compromise my rugby refereeing.
During the course of the year, I've been promoted to the second team and have represented my university at several tournaments. \\
I have been \textbf{elected} to serve as treasurer for the next academic year once again demonstrating my \textbf{ability} and \textbf{recognition} to take on \textbf{responsibilities}.
\\
In my spare time I relax by playing the piano, having achieved Grade 5 some years ago. I hold a full, clean UK driving licence.
