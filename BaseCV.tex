%   PERSONAL PROFILE

\section{Personal Profile/Objective}
I am an undergraduate with a mature outlook seeking a year long industrial placement in Mathematics and/or Computing. I have a very logical mind and demonstrated my ability to understand complex ideas quickly whilst working on a research project at Cardiff University this summer.

\section{Experience}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}

\textsc{Summer} & Building Game Theoretical Software in a Research Environment \\
\textsc{2014}& \footnotesize{I was employed by Cardiff University Department of Mathematics, working for Dr. Vincent Knight to lead the department's contribution to the open source mathematics package, Sage. I was responsible for the implementation of a variety of Game Theoretic algorithms that will be included in a future release of Sage. Areas of Game Theory handled included: Normal Form Games, Co-operative Games and Matching Games. This employment developed my teamwork and communication skills by providing experience of working within a research environment.}\\
\\
%------------------------------------------------
\textsc{Sept 2010 -} & Referee with the Rugby Football Union \\
\textsc{Present} & \footnotesize{Whilst most teenagers might have a Saturday job, I began refereeing rugby union at the age of 15. New referees start at level 15 and by the time I was 18, I had been promoted to level 6 - the highest regional level and only one below the point where I could referee national level games. The experience of taking charge of 30 grown men in an aggressive and physical sport has given me confidence in my ability to remain calm in stressful situations.}\\
\\
%------------------------------------------------
\textsc{Sept 2009 -} & Young Leader at 1\textsuperscript{st} Helsby Scouts\\
\textsc{Jul 2013}& \footnotesize{I developed communication skills whilst helping to supervise and teach children aged 6 - 10 years. I was regularly assigned to lead small group activities which improved my organisation and leadership skills.}\\

%	COMPUTER SKILLS

\section{Programming Skills}
I have a thorough working knowledge of Python and Git, both of which I have used to contribute to a peer reviewed open source project. I am able to create professional documents and presentations using LateX and I have experience with Django, Python's web framework, which I used to build a web application for a University project.

%	INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES
%-----------------------------
\section{Acheivments and Interests}
I have been involved in Scouting from the age of 8, playing a large role in the organistation both as member and a leader. Recently, I was appointed a group-wide, adult leader position which will allow me to continue the work I have been doing whenever I am home from University. \\
\\
<<<<<<< HEAD
I also referee rugby union, and have been doing so since I was 15. Whilst most teenagers might get a Saturday job, I was taking charge of 30 testosterone fuelled men every weekend. As a result I feel very confident in taking charge under a large amount of pressure and have the ability to remain calm in stressful situations. In my spare time I play the piano and reached Grade 5 whilst having lessons, showing commitment and self-motivation. \\
\\
I hold a full, clean UK driving licence.

=======
On starting at Cardif University, I decided to take up a new sport in order to maintain my level of fitness. I chose Ultimate Frisbee as it is a team sport, is physically demanding but is non-contact and so reduces the risk of injury which might compromise my rugby refereeing. During the course of the year, I've been promoted to the second team and have represented my univeristy at several tournaments. \\
\\
In my spare time I relax by playing the piano, having achieved Grade 5 some years ago.
